						<h2>BLOGGING.</h2>
						<p>We're constantly searching for bloggers and influencers that are living out the ideals of a global citizen. We naturally follow dozens of blogs on a range of topics, but we've been set on finding the ones that are really living out sustainability and sharing practical insights on how to change the world around us through simple daily decisions. We've asked our friends on Instagram, scoured our feeds and followed plenty of bunny trails to find these ten sustainable living blogs. </p>

							<p>1. Identify Opportunities for New Partnerships, Coalitions and Investment
With an overwhelming number of SDG targets (169 in total) and 165 incredibly diverse NDCs, there has been no easy way to identify points of alignment at the global, regional or individual level. Now through Climate Watch, the Global Linkage Map enables users to search across all goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and the text of all NDCs. This is particularly useful to understand country priorities, as well as opportunities for new partnerships or investment at the nexus of core climate and sustainable development priories. For example, the eradication of hunger by 2030 (SDG2) will require food systems to become more sustainable and resilient to climate impacts. Those looking to create or strengthen coalitions and initiatives at the intersection of food production and climate can identify NDCs that contain relevant climate targets or actions by using the Global Linkage Map and filtering to SDG2 and the associated targets. From here, users can select countries and go directly to the relevant text of the NDC.



2. Support Countries in Seizing Benefits of Integrated implementation of NDCs and SDGS
Identifying where national priorities for sustainable development and climate align represents a significant challenge for many countries. Undertaking such a mapping exercise is the foundation for effective and sustained implementation. The Country Pages on Climate Watch provide a starting point for this mapping exercise - revealing the links that are apparent from the text of the NDC. Highlighted dots indicate alignment with at least one climate action from the country’s NDC. This mapping provides a useful starting point for countries in identifying how relevant ministries could collaborate and pool resources to achieve aligned targets in a synergistic manner. For example, Uganda’s NDC presents opportunities for collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Water & Environment on priorities that could deliver both mitigation and adaptation while improving local communities’ health and well-being.



3. Identify Opportunities for Further Alignment in Future NDCs
In the process of translating the Paris Agreement into implementation, countries have the opportunity to review and update their NDCs by 2020. Climate Watch enables policymakers to identify opportunities to enhance their NDC through greater alignment with national sustainable development priorities or trends globally. For example, SDG target 12.3 aims to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Around a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, resulting in approximately $940 billion per year in economic losses, food insecurity and an estimated 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Fourteen countries have already included explicit commitments in their NDCs that could contribute to the achievement of 12.3.



In their 2020 NDCs, countries could consider making these links more specific or adding in new commitments aimed at achieving and/or capturing the mitigation impact of reduce food loss and waste along the value chain. For example, the National Food Waste Reduction Strategy recently proposed by Canada, could lead to additional opportunities to strengthen Canada’s NDC and be a catalyst for further reductions across the public and private sector.  </p>

							<h2>Time to Leap Forward to Transformation</h2>

							<p>Never has the need for solutions been more urgent. Every month in 2016 has set a high temperature record, putting the year on track to be the hottest since modern record-keeping began, as 2015 and 2014 were before it. Wildfires have cropped up not just in arid areas like the U.S. Southwest and California but also in Alaska, western Canada and Siberia. Extraordinary storms – the equivalent of six months’ rain falling in three days – caused devastating floods in Louisiana.

The September 25 anniversary of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a ripe moment to take stock of progress over the last 12 months.

On September 3, 2016, the United States and China formally joined the Paris Agreement, putting the agreement within reach of entering into force this year. This is a powerful indicator that momentum for transformation is already underway.

One-hundred eighty-nine countries, whose combined greenhouse emissions make up 98.8 percent of the global total, have offered plans for how they intend to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. Some of those plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, show a shifting landscape that could re-order how we see developed and developing countries as they face the climate challenge.

As countries set climate action priorities, links to the SDGs become clear and critical. The inter-related nature of poverty eradication and climate mitigation and adaptation is starting to have an effect on how policy-makers think.

Looking at the world through the related prisms of the NDCs and SDGs presents a multi-dimensional picture that can’t be seen by looking at either one alone. In this 3-D view, no country is all rich or all poor, though all have responsibilities and needs that are essential and interrelated. Barbados has a higher gross domestic product than Bulgaria, so the Caribbean island nation is rich by that measure – but Bulgaria is in the OECD. Saudi Arabia’s GDP is more than 1 percent of the global total, but it dropped steeply as its oil-based economy weathered shocks in a volatile energy market. China and the United States are the world’s two largest economies, yet both have pockets of poverty.

This broad spectrum of development is the backdrop for delivering on these two agendas. In a world where China and Mexico are both donors and recipients of development aid, we are moving away from traditional notions of rich and poor. Only by working collaboratively and coherently and managing global and local trade-offs intelligently will we be able to deliver well-being for all, now and into the future.

Consider the case of a cabinet-level transport minister. Because of the SDGs and NDCs, that minister can’t think only about transport; that official needs to deal with energy, housing, education and other variables that play into moving people from one place to another – all of which have critical roles to play in climate change mitigation and adaptation. It’s a way of pulling people out of their comfortable siloes toward more cost-effective solutions. Revolutions can start when mindsets shift.

To kick-start transformative action, we need to go beyond incremental change. Without ambitious climate action, we risk losing decades’ worth of development gains. It is imperative to translate the impact of climate action and poverty eradication so that decision-makers around the world understand the pivotal benefits of sustainable, inclusive development – and the long-term costs of locking in high-carbon technologies and methods. Together the NDCs and SDGs can offer persuasive, practical pathways forward.

The momentum is there. Approval of the Paris Agreement is possible just nine months after it was negotiated – warp speed in the world of international negotiations. The SDGs have begun to shift the tenor of the dialogue on development and sectoral priorities. Now we need to put compelling numbers on the table.

This historic year, as the SDGs and Paris Agreement move from inspiring commitments towards real-world implementation, is the time to leap toward the future – and keep on going. </p>
